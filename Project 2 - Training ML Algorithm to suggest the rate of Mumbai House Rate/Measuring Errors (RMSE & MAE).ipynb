    "## <b>Measuring Errors (RMSE & MAE)\n",
    "After training our regression model, we need to evaluate how good its predictions are. Two common metrics used for this are MAE and RMSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n",
    "MAE stands for Mean Absolute Error. It calculates the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Formula</b>: MAE = (1/n) × sum of |actual - predicted|\n",
    "\n",
    "- It treats all errors equally, no matter their size.\n",
    "- MAE is based on the Manhattan norm (also called L1 norm), which measures distance by summing absolute values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>2. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n",
    "RMSE stands for Root Mean Squared Error. It calculates the square root of the average of squared differences between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Formula</b>: RMSE = sqrt((1/n) × sum of (actual - predicted)²)\n",
    "\n",
    "- RMSE gives more weight to larger errors because it squares them.\n",
    "- RMSE is based on the Euclidean norm (also called L2 norm), which measures straight-line distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Summary\n",
    "- <b>Use MAE</b> when all errors should be treated equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Use RMSE</b> when larger errors should be penalized more."
