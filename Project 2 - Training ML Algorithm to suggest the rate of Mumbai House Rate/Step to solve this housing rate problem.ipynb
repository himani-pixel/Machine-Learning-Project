    "First, we’ll check if this is a < B>supervised</b> or <b>unsupervised</b> learning task. Since we have historical data with house prices (our target), and we want to predict the price of a house based on input features, this is a <b>supervised learning</b> problem.\n",

    "Next, we observe that the model is predicting <b>one continuous label</b> — the price of a house — based on several input features. This makes it a <b>univariate regression problem.</b>"
