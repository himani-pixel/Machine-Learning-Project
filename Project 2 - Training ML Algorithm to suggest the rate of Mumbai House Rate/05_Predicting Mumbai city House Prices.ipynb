    "## <b>Predicting Mumbai City House Prices</b>\n",
    "### <b>Why Are We Building This?</b>\n",
    "Mumbai, a rapidly growing city in India, has seen a sharp rise in real estate development over the past decade. With its proximity to Maharashtra, booming IT hubs, and modern infrastructure, Mumbai has become a major attraction for both homebuyers and investors. However, the real estate market here is highly dynamic and often difficult to assess without proper data-driven tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re building a Mumbai house price prediction model to help:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how factors like location, area, region, and type affect property prices in Mumbai.\n",
    "- Assist buyers in identifying fair prices based on historical trends.\n",
    "- Help sellers estimate an appropriate asking price.\n",
    "- Empower real estate agents and platforms to improve recommendations and negotiations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <B>How Will We Build It?</b>\n",
    "While we don’t have access to a large, clean dataset of house prices in Mumbai right now, we will use a well-known and cleaned dataset—the Mumbai housing dataset—as a proxy. This will allow us to build, test, and evaluate a working model with real-world variables like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- bhk\n",
    "- type\tlocality\n",
    "- area\tprice\n",
    "- price_unit\n",
    "- region\tstatus\n",
    "- age\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "We’ll treat this as a simulation: suppose the Mumabi data is Mumbai data, and suppose we are building this model for a neighborhood where both you and I live or work nearby.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model is developed and understood, we can later adapt the same approach to real Mumbai data when available, using the same techniques and logic."
