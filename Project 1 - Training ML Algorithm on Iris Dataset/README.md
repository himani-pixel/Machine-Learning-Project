## <b>Machine Learning Projects</b>

### <B>Welcome to my Machine Learning journey </b>
This repository is a growing collection of hands-on ML projects where I explore core concepts, algorithms, and practical implementations using Python.

The goal of this repo is simple:
learn by building, one project at a time.

### <B>Project 1: Training ML Algorithms on the Iris Dataset</b>

This project focuses on understanding the end-to-end workflow of a basic Machine Learning model using the classic Iris dataset.

#### <B>What this project covers:</b>
	•	Loading and exploring a dataset
	•	Understanding features and target labels
	•	Splitting data into training and testing sets
	•	Training a machine learning algorithm
	•	Making predictions
	•	Evaluating model performance

This project is intentionally kept simple and beginner-friendly, serving as a strong foundation for more advanced models in the future.

### <b>Tech Stack</b>
	•	Python
	•	NumPy
	•	Pandas
	•	Scikit-learn
	•	Jupyter Notebook

#### <B>Purpose of This Repository</b>
	•	Build a strong foundation in Machine Learning
	•	Practice concepts through real code, not just theory
	•	Maintain a public learning log
	•	Gradually move from basic models to advanced ML & AI projects
