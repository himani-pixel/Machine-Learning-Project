# <i><b>Machine Learning Projects</b></i>

This repository documents my journey into Machine Learning, starting from the absolute basics and gradually moving toward more advanced concepts. The early projects here are intentionally simple—they’re built to understand fundamentals, not to chase complexity.

Over time, this repository will grow to include multiple projects covering different machine learning techniques, datasets, and problem types.

## <b>Purpose of This Repository</b>
	•	Build a strong foundation in machine learning
	•	Learn concepts through hands-on implementation
	•	Track progress from beginner to more advanced projects
	•	Create a structured collection of ML work

Each project represents a step forward in learning.

## <b>What You’ll Find Here<b>
	•	Basic machine learning implementations
	•	Experiments with datasets
	•	Model training and prediction workflows
	•	Gradual increase in project complexity

Early projects focus on clarity and understanding rather than optimization or performance.

## <b> Tools & Technologies</b>
	•	Python
	•	Pandas
	•	NumPy
	•	Scikit-learn

Additional libraries and tools may be added as the projects evolve.

## <b>Growth Mindset</b>

This repository is a work in progress.
As my understanding of machine learning deepens, the projects here will reflect that growth—moving from simple ideas to more complex, real-world problems.

Learning is iterative. This repo shows that iteration in action.
